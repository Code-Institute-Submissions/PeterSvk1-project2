This is a simple game where you can play Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock against the computer.
You will ne challanged by computer and hopefully you can win. This game has element of chance so you will never know the outcome.
I hope users will enjoy this functionality and and find it relaxing to play, users have nothing to lose other than their mind if they lose too many times.
